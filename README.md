# UI-UX-Experiment1

## Aim:
To explore and understand the fundamentals of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, differentiate between them using real-world examples, illustrate their interrelationship, and demonstrate the use of various UI/UX design tools for practical application.

## Algorithm:
Start the experiment.

Study the Fundamentals:

Understand the basic concepts of UI (visual design, layout, color, typography) and UX (usability, user flow, accessibility).

Note the key differences and similarities between UI and UX.

Differentiate Using Case Studies:

Select two or more real-world applications (e.g., Swiggy, Amazon, Instagram).

Analyze how UI elements (colors, icons, typography) and UX elements (navigation flow, usability, feedback) differ in each case.

Record the findings in a comparison table.

Illustrate the Relationship Between UI and UX:

Create a diagram or flowchart showing how UI and UX interact in the design process.

Explain how both contribute to overall product success.

Demonstrate UI/UX Design Tools:

Open a design tool such as Figma or Adobe XD.

Create a simple design prototype (for example, a login page, food delivery screen, or homepage layout).

Add interactive components (buttons, text fields, navigation).

Test the user flow and collect feedback.

Analyze and Observe:

Observe how the UI elements affect the UX experience.

Modify design elements to improve usability or aesthetics.

Conclude the experiment by summarizing:

The key differences between UI and UX.

The relationship between them.

The usefulness of tools in improving design quality.

Stop the experiment.
